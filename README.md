✈️ Airline Operations Disruption Analysis

MBA Business Analytics | Python Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
* Airline operations are highly sensitive to disruptions such as delays and cancellations, which significantly impact passenger experience and operational efficiency.
* This project presents a **data-driven analysis of airline operational disruptions**, focusing on delay severity, cancellation patterns, airport-level impact, and passenger disruption.
* The objective is to transform raw flight operations data into **actionable business insights** that support operational decision-making and recovery planning.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Analyze flight delays and cancellations during disruption events
* Quantify disruption impact using a **Disruption Severity Index (DSI)**
* Identify high-impact airports contributing most to network-wide disruption
* Estimate passenger impact across disruption phases
* Translate analytical findings into **business recommendations**

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

* **Total Records:** 500 flights
* **Airline:** IndiGo (case study – simulated data)
* **Airports Covered:** DEL, BOM, BLR, HYD, CCU
* **Time Phases:**

  * Pre-disruption
  * Disruption
  * Recovery

### Key Features

* Departure delay (minutes)
* Flight status (On-Time, Delayed, Cancelled)
* Estimated passenger count
* Disruption phase

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation & analysis
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis workflow

---

## 🔍 Methodology

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering for delay severity and cancellation flags
* Creation of **Disruption Severity Index (DSI)**
* Passenger impact estimation based on delay thresholds
* KPI analysis across disruption phases
* Visualization of trends and operational insights

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* **55.4% of flights experienced delays** during the analysis period
* **9.4% of flights were cancelled**, significantly increasing passenger impact
* Disruption Severity Index showed **sharp spikes during incident days**
* A small number of **hub airports contributed disproportionately** to total disruption
* Recovery from disruption was **gradual and uneven**, indicating operational strain

---

## 💡 Business Impact

This analysis helps airlines to:

* Detect early signs of operational disruption
* Prioritize recovery efforts at **high-impact hub airports**
* Reduce passenger dissatisfaction during irregular operations
* Improve **data-driven decision-making** in operations management

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Integration of **real-time flight data**
* Predictive disruption alerts using machine learning
* Interactive dashboards using **Power BI / Tableau**
* Route-level and fleet-level disruption analysis
